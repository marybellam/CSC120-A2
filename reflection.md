What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was very confusing to start the assignment. There was a lot of not knowing what to do or confusion on how to get started on the methods. I would tell someone taking this cource in the future to start working on the assignment early and go to TA hours for assstance and don't be afraid to ask for help.
